# checker-board-game
```
1. Block & piece color are customisable (user will be able to change any time base on selected color)
2. On the valid term user will be able to make valid move(A valid move can only be in left, right and forward.)
3. A player can't move pieces directly on the checker board. He has to select one from all the possible paths from a popup,
   which would come up automatically when it's his turn. That popup should contain all possible moves for current player
   from his/her current position in form of checkboxes. One have to select just one possible path from those checkboxes
   and press OK button. After pressing the OK button, the popup should close and the result of current player's
   selection should be reflected as a completed move on the checker board.
